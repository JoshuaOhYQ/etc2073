# Chapter 1: First Order Logic and Expert Systems

## What is Logic ?!?!

+ Logic is a systematic representation of information and knowledge to be communicated to machine.
+ It is expressed using specific <span style="color:green;">syntax</span> of the representation language to define the <span style="color:green;">semantics</span> of the sentences.
+ __<span style="color:green;">syntax</span>__ : identify if an expression is well formed
+ __<span style="color:green;">semantics</span>__ : identify the meaning of an expression

| Language            | What Exists Within the Language (Ontological Commitment) | What an agent believes about facts (Epistemological commitment) |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Propositional logic | Facts                           | True/False                 |
| First order logic   | Facts, objects, relations       | True/False                 |
| Temporal logic      | Facts, objects, relations, time| True/False                 |
| Probability theory  | Facts                           | Degree of belief ∈ [0, 1]  |
| Fuzzy logic         | Facts with degree of truth ∈ [0, 1] | Known interval value       |


### Propositional logic
####Logical connective:

| Symbol | Name         | Example | English equivalent                  |
|--------|--------------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| ∧      | conjunction  | p ∧ q   | p and q                             |
| ∨      | disjunction  | p ∨ q   | p or q                              |
| ¬ or ∼ | negation     | ¬p or ∼p| not p                               |
| ⇒      | implication  | p ⇒ q   | p implies q<br>if p then q          |
| ⟺      | biconditional| p ⟺ q   | p if and only if q<br>p equivalent to q |  

Derivative connective such as __XOR(Exclusive OR)__ and __NOR(Negation of OR)__ are also valid and can be formed using the basic logical operators listed above. 🙂

#### Antecedent and consequence:
+ Antecedent: The "IF" part of a conditional statement
+ Consequent: The "Then" part of a conditional statement
+ Example:<br>If __r__ and __p__ then __q__<br>__r__ ∧ __p__ ⇒ __q__<br>Antecedent (IF) = __r__ ∧ __p__<br>Consequent (Then) = __q__
+ Antecedent and consequence is used to describe components of a conditional statement, often referred to as an __implication__ (only __FALSE__ when antecedent is true and consequent is false, otherwise it is __TRUE__) ❗❗❗
  
#### Syntax:
+ Syntax is how an expression (statement) can be formed
+ A correctly formed statement has a meaning within the definition of the language
+ In simple words, syntax is the way to write the statements
+ Examples:<br>
  | Statements | Comment  |   
  |------------|----------|
  | p   | a fact  | 
  | p ∧ q  | a conjunction of 2 facts |
  | x4y + =  | not a well-formed expression |
  | 3x + y  | a well-formed arithmetic expression |
  | 3x + y > 2  | a valid mathematical inequality |
  
+ __Correct syntax__ : p ∧ q<br>Incorrect syntax: p ∧ (incomplete statement)
+ __Statements__ also called sentences in logic
